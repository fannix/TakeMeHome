# TakeMeHome

## Introduction

This is the Andorid app for for the project [TakeMeHome](https://fannix.github.io/blockchain/2018/03/04/TakeMeHome.html)

To run this app, you need to create two smart contracts. For testing purpose, I already deploy two contracts in testnet,

please take a look at the the contract project page for the codes and the addresses at  <https://github.com/fannix/TakeMeHomeContract>.


## compilation and testing

To compile the project, you will need to install AndroidStudio.

To test it, you need an android device, either with a real one or a simulated one. I already tested it with a real Samgsung Galaxy tab s3 (API 27).
You also need a real iBeacon or a Beacon simulator. I used the locate ios app which is developed by Radius Networks,
and used the Null iBeacon (id1: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 id2: 0 id3: 0) to trigger beacon events.
